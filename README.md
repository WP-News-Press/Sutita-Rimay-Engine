Sutita Rimay: Fact-Checking with Cultural Identity 🔍✨
"Speak the Truth" (Quechua) | Powered by WP News

Project Overview
Sutita Rimay is the verification arm of our ecosystem. It is a specialized engine designed to identify, analyze, and debunk misinformation (Fake News) targeting the Hispanic community in the United States, specifically in the Hudson Valley area.

Key Features
Spanglish NLP: Optimized to understand the unique linguistic blend and cultural nuances of our local community.

Visual Forensic Analysis: Toolset to identify manipulated media and "fake" screenshots (like the Epstein/De Soto hoax).

Actionable Truth: Every verified fact comes with a "What to do next" guide to empower the user.

Integration
This engine works as the "truth filter" for Hispabot. Before our AI assistant provides a resource, it ensures the information is verified through Sutita Rimay's logic.
